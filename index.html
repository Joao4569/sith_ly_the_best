      <h3>Game Rules</h3>
        <p>1- The objective of the game is to find all matching pairs of cards.</p>
        <p>2- The game board consists of a grid of facedown cards.</p>
        <p>3- On each turn, you can flip two cards to reveal their faces.</p>
        <p>4- If the two flipped cards have the same image, they remain face up and are considered a match.</p>
        <p>5- If the two flipped cards have different images, they are flipped back facedown.</p>
        <p>6- Remember the positions of the cards as you flip them to help you find matching pairs.</p>
        <p>7- The game continues until all the cards are matched and faced up.</p>
        <p>8- The game is won when all the cards are matched, and a message or a prompt can be displayed to signify the completion of the game.</p>
        <p>9- Enjoy and try to beat your own record time!.</p>
